# micro-hab
This repository is for the minimalistic high-altitude balloon (HAB) board which will serve as a learning experience for new RIT SPEX members by providing:

* Soldering experience with both surface mount technology (SMT) and through-hole

* Programming experience through an Arduino-compatible microcontroller

* System-level experience by providing all necessary functions for a HAB launch and flight

Individuals working on this project will be able to apply what they learn in the classroom towards a physical project that represents one of the cheapest and easiest forms of basic space exploration.
